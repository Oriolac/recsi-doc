Put some images, maybe?

- Selling personal information.
- Can be used for other purposes than predicting the energy
  consumption in a day.

* Busom Solution
** Setup
- Private Key :: $x_i$
- Public key :: $y_i = g^x_i$
- Group Key :: $y = \Pi_{i=1}^n y_i$

#+begin_comment
Server checks that everyone is who say it is.

** Cipher and Decipher
1. Smart-meters send an ElGamal encryption
   \[ E_y(g^{m_i + z_i}) = (c_i, d_i) \]
2. The system computes and sends $c$ to the users.
   \[ C = (\Pi _{i=1}^{n} c_i, \Pi _{i=1}^{n} d_i) = (g^r, g^{m + z} * y^{r}) = (c, d) \]
#+REVEAL: split
3. [@3] Every smart-meter computes and sends $T_i$
   \[ T_i = c^{x_i} g^{z_i} \]
4. The system computes
   \[ D = d  (\Pi _{i=1}^{n} T_i)^{-1} = (g^{m+z}  y^r)  (g^{z}  y^r)^{-1} = g^m \]
5. Then we solve the discrete logarithm
   \[ m = \log_g D \]

** Decipher
** The problem with Busom
#+begin_comment
Explain that
- An attacker can get every two rounds a message from one person,
  discarding every other message
#+end_comment
* RECSI
** Setup
#+begin_comment
- Elliptic Curve (p192) with the generator.
- Hash function (SHA-256)
#+end_comment
** Key Establishment

\[ s'_0 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} {s_i} = -s_0 \; (mod \; p) \]

#+begin_comment
- Use Busom as it can not be exploited to get personal information.
#+end_comment
** Consumption Transmission
*** Cipher
\[ C_i =  m_i P + s_i H(t) \]

*** Decipher
\[ C =  \sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i = m P + \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i  * H(t) \]

\[ D = C + s_o H(t) = m P + s H(t) = m P \]

Where:
\[ s = s_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i = 0 \]

*** Discrete Logarithm
- Brute Force
- Pollard's Lambda
- Cached Brute Force

#+begin_comment
Explain that the discrete logarithm is solvable because
the message is always small (adding all of them can't be higher than 10000).
