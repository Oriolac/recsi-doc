	One of the most important points of the report is the better performance in data retransmission. After establishing the key, the experimental cost only depends on deciphering one datagram for smart meter. As it shows figure \ref{fig:busom}, the experimental cost of \cite{busom} retransmission is an upper bound from the consumption transmission phase of the protocol.
