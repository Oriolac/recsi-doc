	In this paper, a system that allows to remove the need of a trusted
	third party during the key establishment phase of an existing privacy-preserving smart metering system is implemented. The security analysis of such system is explained and proved in the paper \cite{recsi}.\\

	Also, the proposed solver of the discrete logarithm was tested and finally
	found a better method with the requirements. As exposed in this paper, mesmerizing some values with a fixed range improves the time of execution.
	Moreover, the results in time of the simulation makes the system a good approach for production of smart meters.\\
	
	Finally, the cost in memory and computation of the solver of a discrete
	logarithm has been observed and tested to be the most influential in how
	the system can work for a large number of smart meters.
