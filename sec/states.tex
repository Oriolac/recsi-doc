As it is designed as a state machine pattern, there are two states, which are represented also in the protocol RECSI:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Key Establishment. Produces the secret key of every smart meter and the private key of the substation executing the Busom protocol.
	\item Consumption Transmission. After the key is established, when every smart meter of the neighbourhood reads its consumption and send its cipher, the substation receives all the ciphered messages and deciphers them using an instance of a class that implements LogarithmAlgorithm.
\end{enumerate}
