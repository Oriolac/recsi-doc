  As the purpose of the implementation was to know if the cryptosystem was
   good for production, a test of the cost in time for sending packages was
   needed. \\
   
   The experimental cost analysis was done executing a computer with an \texttt{Intel Core i5 CPU 650} processor running at \texttt{3.20} GHz with \texttt{7.6} GB of RAM, using two cores.\\
   
   The result given in table \ref{ana:tab1}, made it clear that
   the system is capable of holding at least 128 smart meters. 
   
   Even though,
   there are still some points that the test fails to show. The first point is the problem in connectivity of the aggregated system, as the test were done in a single machine, using the interface of localhost.
   The second point refers to the number of meters and the problem of simulating the infrastructure in a single machine. As the computer used for testing only has available two cores for processing, when using 129 threads for simulating (128 smart meters and 1 substation), the time of switching between process skyrockets.
