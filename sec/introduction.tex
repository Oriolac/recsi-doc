   Smart meters are household devices that collects and sends the electricity
   consumption to an energy supplier in small intervals. With this, better
   predictions and consumption trends can be made so the production can be closer to what it really is, leading to an accurate billing, reduced prices.\\

   Although beneficial in a large scale, the amount of information given by a single house can be used to make predictions of the living in the household, as when they arrive home, watch TV, or goes to bed. For this problems, the system described in \cite{recsi}
   was designed. This paper describes an implementation of the cryptosystem to study the costs in time of the cryptosystem. The implementation can be found at [ ]%TODO add github link
   , and in order to function properly it needs the library at the [ ]
   %TODO add the other github link
   . Other dependencies and further instructions to set up the system can be found at the README.md of the first link.

   There is a change in how the discrete logarithm is solved in the implementation, as it was found out a better way to solve it, described in
   the section \ref{wrapp:sec}.
